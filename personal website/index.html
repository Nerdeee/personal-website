        <h1>George Larres</h1>
        <p>Hi, my name is George Larres and I am pursuing my Bachelors of Science in Computer Science at California State University, Fresno. I am interested in multiple 
           disciplines in Computer Science but have recently been spending my time learning more about web development and computer graphics. I haver completed several courses
           in IP and networking, which is another field I am interesed in. When I am not working or programming, I like to play guitar, take care of my fish, read, and play
           video games. Thank you for checking out my website. The site showcases some of my work and my completed coursework as well as links to my GitHub and my Linkedin.</p>
